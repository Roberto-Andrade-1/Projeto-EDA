# Projeto-EDA
This is the first project of the course Algorithms and Data Structures.
The objective of this project is to develop a program in c++ language, in which we had to use arrays, structs, and other things.
I delivered the project with some problems, the method of gestao "removerManualmente" does not remove the car, it only displays that the car was removed
but it wasn't, and that generated another error, the money that the staation made would go to a big negativ number because of that. Also another error was,
when the upload from a file of the stations was made, it isn't possible to do cicles.
And that's probably what affacted my grade, since I had a 16.82 out of 20.
